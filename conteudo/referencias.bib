	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A novel {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variant, {VOC} 202012/01, emerged in southeast England in November 2020 and appears to be rapidly spreading towards fixation. We fitted a two-strain mathematical model of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transmission to observed {COVID}-19 hospital admissions, hospital and {ICU} bed occupancy, and deaths; {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {PCR} prevalence and seroprevalence; and the relative frequency of {VOC} 202012/01 in the three most heavily affected {NHS} England regions (South East, East of England, and London). We estimate that {VOC} 202012/01 is 56\% more transmissible (95\% credible interval across three regions 50-74\%) than preexisting variants of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. We were unable to find clear evidence that {VOC} 202012/01 results in greater or lesser severity of disease than preexisting variants. Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with {COVID}-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained. Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number ​R​t​ to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed. We project that large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures. It may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
